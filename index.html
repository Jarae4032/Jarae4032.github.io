        <p>
          Hi. My interests include reading, videogames, 
          and basketball. Although I don't get play video games 
          as much anymore. I have five brothers, two sisters, 
          and three dogs.   
        </p>

          I'm not sure exactly what my plans are 
          after school, but I do plan on going to college. I'm 
          thinking about getting a degree in psychology. Some skills
          I have learned in class are coding, problem solving, and 
          responsibility.
