        <p>
          Hi. My interests include reading, videogames, 
          and basketball. I like to mainly read fantasy 
          and some of my favorite games are halo and call 
          of duty. I have five brothers, two sisters, 
          and three dogs. I'm the fourth child and usually 
          the one to make sure no one kills anyone. 
        </p>

          I'm not sure exactly what my plans are 
          after school, but I do plan on going to college. I'm 
          thinking about getting a degree in psychology or maybe 
          science. I'm interested in a lot of things, but hopefully 
          I'll figure that out soon. Some skills I have learned in 
          class are coding in python, html, java, converting to binary, 
          and problem solving.
        </p>
